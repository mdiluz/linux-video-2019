# Linux Gaming Montage 2019
This is a living document describing the production of a sequal to last year's crowdsourced [./Games](https://youtu.be/3U8bLArlRXw) montage, this year to show off where gaming on Linux is at in 2019, specifically also including Proton games. On [the wiki](https://github.com/mdiluz/linux-video-2019/wiki) you'll find instructions on how to contribute and rules on what will be accepted.

This year, I intend to create two videos. One for a normal upload, like last years, and also a short form social media video, to help spread the word a little further.

### Video Forms
* Long-form video to be uploaded to Youtube, 1920x1080, a few minutes long
* Short square video for easy sharing on Twitter/Insta or gif/WebM form 1080x1080, max 60 seconds, audio not required

### Video License
The videos will be released under a [CC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license, the exact form yet to be decided.

### Production
The video will be produced entirely with Open Source video and audio software e.g. ffmpeg, kdenlive and audacity. It'll be made up of a combination of personally recorded clips and those submitted from anyone who's willing to help.

### Contributing
As with the first video, I'll be crowd-sourcing clips from games I don't own. Please head to [the clip registry](https://github.com/mdiluz/linux-video-2019/wiki/Clip-Registry) for details on how to contribute.
